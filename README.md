## Spacebar

A very simple macos application which just shows your current space in the menu bar.

---

### About

For the longest time i used WhichSpace(https://github.com/gechr/WhichSpace).
But that has some issues and no longer seems to be maintained.
None of the other apps did exactly just show the active space so i made my own.

Spacebar should work nicely on both dark/light mode as it just uses sf-symbols.

### Installation

* Download and open the latest released dmg file from github.
* Move spacebar to applications folder.
* This app is not signed with a paid developer account so you have to approve it in Security settings. (if you don't trust me you can always build it from source :wink: )
* (Optional:) If you want to launch the app on startup, just add it to your login items. (System Settings -> Login Items)
